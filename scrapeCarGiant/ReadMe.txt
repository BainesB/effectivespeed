# Get all the car info off car giant to have a look at what cars actuall cost. 
# I want to be able to see how many car they have in each band. 


# Most I have been able to do this. I occation got an error, that said a list was out of range in my CleanUp_Notes function. 

# Rather thand debug this, I just skipped to the next page by making an new Soup.py script that started on the next page. 

# So I am missing a couple of pages of result, but I'm thinking I now have a big enough db of car prices to play with and look at. 


# push this to github. 

# you could add a bit to you app that tells people what kind of car they could pay for in an hour a day. 

# Then mean car price is £12762 
# Then mode car prices is £10-11K
