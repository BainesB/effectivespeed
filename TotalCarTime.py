    # Milage time average speed. 
    # There is such a lot of variance that you might have to build and app for this. 
    # I cant get an overall average car speed of the UK, so perhaps it just easier to build it for the indvidual. 
    # you can work out the time for their commute, then take that off the annul milage, then work out what the sort of speed they are doing on the rest of the driving.

    # 59.5mph seem to be the ave speed across the 'strategic rd network. 
    # so lets use that for the none comute speed.
